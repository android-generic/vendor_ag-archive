Subject: [PATCH 21/23] Don't fail first stage mount if fstab is not found

The first stage mount looks for default fstab, but we rely on properties
to find fstab.${ro.hardware}. However properties are not available yet
in that stage. Prior to Android S, failure to find default fstab at that
stage was non fatal. As we don't need the first stage mount, just make
it non fatal again.
