Subject: [PATCH 03/14] FLACExtractor: Add more sample rates support

In FLACExtractor.cpp, it has function to check file's sample rate.
If the input sample rate is not in its list, it will return "unsupported
sample rate" issue. Modify code to make other sample rates (100,1k,42k,46k)
pass the check

Issue: AXIA-1441
